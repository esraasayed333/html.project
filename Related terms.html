  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 192);">Algorithm </h2>
<h4>A set of rules that a machine can follow to learn how to do a task. </h4>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Backward Chaining</h2>
<h4>A method where the model starts with the desired output and works to find data that might support it. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 199);">Bias</h2>
<h4>Assumptions made by a model that simplify the process of learning to do its assigned task. Most supervised machine learning models perform better with low bias, as these assumptions can negatively affect results. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Big Data</h2>
<h4>Datasets that are too large or complex to be used by traditional data processing applications. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Bounding Box</h2>
<h4>Commonly used in image or video tagging, this is an imaginary box drawn on an image. The contents of the box are labeled to help a model recognize it as a distinct type of object. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 192);">Chatbot</h2>
<h4>A program that is designed to communicate with people through text or voice commands in a way that mimics human-to-human conversation. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 190);">Computational Learning Theory</h2>
<h4>A field within artificial intelligence that is primarily concerned with creating and analyzing machine learning algorithms. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 196);">Corpus</h2>

  <h4>A large dataset of written or spoken material that can be used to train a machine to perform linguistic tasks. </h4>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Data Mining</h2>
  <h4>The process of analyzing datasets in order to discover new patterns that might improve the model. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 192);">Data Science</h2>

  <h4>Drawing from statistics, computer science and information science, this interdisciplinary field aims to use a variety of scientific methods, processes and systems to solve problems involving data.
  </h4>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Entity Annotation</h2>
  <h4>The process of labeling unstructured sentences with information so that a machine can read them. For example, this could involve labeling all people, organizations and locations in a document. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Entity Extraction</h2>

  <h4>An umbrella term referring to the process of adding structure to data so that a machine can read it. This may be done by humans or by a machine learning model. </h4>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 14, 206);">Forward Chaining</h2>
  <h4>A method in which a machine must work from a problem to find a potential solution. By analyzing a range of hypotheses, the AI must determine which are relevant to the problem. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 194);">Hyperparameter</h2>
  <h4>Occasionally used interchangeably with parameter, although the terms have some subtle differences. Hyperparameters are values that affect the way your model learns. They are usually set manually outside the model. </h4>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 13, 197);">Label</h2>
  <h4>A part of training data which identifies the desired output for that particular piece of data. </h4>
